***Question******
Keb is an experimental physicist. His works primarily relate to the field of Subatomic particles.
Keb is working on behavior of certain particles, which he calls Z-particles. These particles tend to interact with every other particle in its group. Keb worked out that, similar to electrons experiencing the Screening Effect in an atom, every other Z-particle experiences a similar effect. If he places N of these particles in a contained environment where each Z-particle has some amount of charge Ai, then the effect on ith particle is the product of the charge of every other particle in the system.

Keb has set up a system which has N number of Z-particles. An array A, of size N is given where Ai is the charge on the ith particle. Find the effect on each of the Z-particles in the given system.

Input Format
First line contains an integer N.
Second line contains N space separated integers, denoting the charge Ai.

Constraints
1 <= N <= 105
|Ai| <= 100

Output Format
Print the effect on the particles of the system in a space-separated manner.

Sample Input
3
1 2 3
Sample Output
6 3 2
Explanation
The System has 3 particles, wherein effect on 1st particle is 2 × 3 = 6, on 2nd particle is 1 × 3, and on 3rd particle is 1 × 2, giving the output as 6, 3, 2.
Note: Multiplying all the charges and dividing the product by the charge for ith Z-particle, to calculate the effect on it, may give unexpected results.
